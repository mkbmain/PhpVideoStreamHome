# PhpVideoStreamHome

Simply Create a folder called movie at same level can fill it with movies the php will generate a list of them click the one you want it will play 


I use it purely for streaing movies from pc to tv and console at my house but does work if you do port forwarding over internet enjoy.


The raw code is in all src so you can host it any where.


but there is also a docker compose with default config for nginx largely borrowed\stolen from this.
